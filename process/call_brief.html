    <h1>Brief: Redesign the 'Call Your Representative' Online User Experience</h1>
    <h2>Goal 1: Use UX Psychology rules + <span id="fun-mo-graph">Motion Graphics</span> to enhance the user's experience and produce better results</h2>
    <h2>Goal 2: Drive more people to complete the process of calling their rep</h2>
<h1>Existing process</h1>
<div class="">
  show 3 websites
  <a href="https://5calls.org/#issue/recSWqDICerrEOUDC">5calls.org</a>
</div>

<h1>Assessment</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Clutter</li>
  <li>Makes process look overly complicated</li>
  <li>Drop-off because of asking too much of the user (login, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Solution: What can motion do?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Guide your eye from state A to state B in areas of confusion</li>
  <li>keep a screen decluttered by animating in elements when they are needed</li>
  <li>let the user know that the application is working for them</li>
  <li>provide fun feedback - surpise and delight makes a more memorable experience</li>
  <li>succinctly explain things in place of words</li>

</ul>

<h1>Solution: What UX Rules can we apply?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Always let the user know where they are in the process</li>
  <li>Buy-in: If you can break down what you are asking of the user, ask for the smallest simplest thing first and then work your way up</li>
  <li>Social Pressure: Let user know how many other people are doing it</li>

</ul>

<h1> <a href="http://itp.evejweinberg.com/call" target="_blank">Solution: Design 1</a></h1>
<p>Finding 1: The entire userflow can be reduced to three simple steps:</p>

<p>Finding 2: All 3 steps are simple enough to be on screen at once</p>
<p>Finding 3: Ask for their topic first, bc that is why they are here. 2nd easiest thing to ask for is zipcode. Third step - path of least friction is to have us call them</p>
